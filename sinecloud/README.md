What It Is
SineCloud is designed to bring you an endless stream of mixtapes from various radio stations. With just a few clicks, you can get playlists that have been carefully curated to suit your musical taste. It leverages the power of the SoundCloud API to fetch these mixtapes and present them in an easy-to-use interface.

Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:

React: For the frontend user interface.
Express.js: Backend server to handle API requests and serve frontend assets.
Vanilla CSS: Styling the web pages without any CSS frameworks.
RESTful APIs: Interfacing with the SoundCloud API to fetch data.
What I've Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I have learned:

Working with APIs: Got hands-on experience in fetching data from third-party services like SoundCloud.
Data Fetching: Understood how to asynchronously fetch and handle data in a real-world application.
Dynamic Creation of UI components with React: Learned how to dynamically create and manage React components based on the fetched data.
Deploying Full Stack Project: Gained experience in deploying both frontend and backend services.
Challenges Faced
The following challenges were faced during the development of this project:

Logic of React: Understanding and implementing React logic especially in terms of state and props.
Complex React Components: Figuring out how to break down the app into smaller, more manageable React components.
API Limitations: Faced issues with getting the API to run smoothly and provide the needed data efficiently.
What Is Still There To Fix
There are some areas that need improvement:

Data Fetching Time: Currently, the time taken to fetch data from the API and render it on the frontend is longer than ideal.
Features: Many features like sorting and filtering mixtapes are yet to be added.
About Section: The About section requires more detailed information about the project.
Caching and Storage: Plans to implement better data caching and server-sided storage are underway to improve performance.
